        The world is more complex than ever before with about 7 billion people living on the Earth, which experts estimate the number will even rise up to 9 billion. Physics, chemistry, biology, geography, urbanology, computer science, etc are not anymore distant subjects to be studied separately. As those mutually influence each other like living organisms, multidisciplinary approach is the very basic premise to solve challenging global scale problems we are faced with. 
Companies born, grow, become strong and eventually like babies. If a company goes beyond the unstable period to become a man, it becomes more short-sighted, conservative, and likely to reject adventurous and risky trials and errors, because it is extremely fearful to lose when the scale is big. It sits on a plateau and gets intoxicated by short-term sweet rewards, which result in an eventual disaster hard to revert to. To make it worse, bigger size demands extra supervision that can be invested in R&D instead, which will lead to a long-term catastrophe again. Therefore, affluent quality supply on the basis of unlimited possibility determines how a baby or startup becomes afterwards.

            If we have ever questioned why people cannot live any longer than 132 years, an elephant live longer than a mouse, most of the companies die within 10 years while cities do not seem die easily, the scaling power law might show us the answer. Scaling means a sort of general systematic rule applied as the increase of the size. For example, if an animal is twice bigger than the other one, it has not twice longer longevity but 75%, which is called sublinear scaling<br><br>
The best example of the system complex can be an organism. A human is not a sum of the cells in its body. We have consciousness, unconsciousness, characteristics, perspective and traits that characterize each individual. One funny point is that, even if we know how the cells work individually, we have no idea how the cells will affect the body in the end. A complex system means that individual constituent abide by certain rules to compose a system, where the final prediction of the system cannot be made.

            As the consequence of the globalisation, it is no doubt that the global sustainability is a significant agenda we have the major interest. It is easy to hear around about the possible outcomes relating to global warming, climate changes, future energy and environment choices. However those ways of narrow-sighted thinking, considering we are living in a complex system where it is impossible to predict the whole by analysing the individuals, is like focusing on one tree in the middle of a vast forest. In actuality we have to realise a broad and more scientific and conceptual framework that guides us to a grand unified theory of sustainability with multidisciplinary researches and insights. Cities are like organism in that they born, grow, evolve, cease to grow and die. However, the major difference is that the social network dynamic underlying superliner scaling leads to open-ended growth with the increase of the population, which means that it requires more accordingly. In the end, we will fall with the limited resources, according to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy. We will have to make a transition to a new phase with the creativeness and innovativeness by resetting the parameters, before reaching the singularity. But another problem is that the time taken between innovations is getting shorter, which means that we have to generate inventiveness in a faster rate to avoid the singularity. We might need to find a way of re-defining “progress” or should be content with what we have to keep the ecological equilibrium on the planet by suppressing our nature greedy instincts. But, I don’t think so. People will keep being greedy, and to keep the super-exponential expansion we will have not to content with the equilibrium but to keep challenging ourselves to promote continuous adaptation. It is the time to understand the complex systems and the universality law that covers “the entire forest”, not just one tree
