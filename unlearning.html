          We must have once imagined time travel. The desire gets stronger out of curiosity to better understand and predict the unknown future. Making Prediction has been one of our major interests in many areas. Bayes’s rule suggests that three different distributions (normal, power-law and Earlang) have their own corresponding optimal prediction rules (multiplicative, average and additive). Choosing the right strategy is the key point for more accurate predictions. However, data given as prior knowledge cannot be stressed enough. For example, doctors in Korea understand the body qualities of Korean people better than other races. When experiencing new situations, we gather information as much as possible to react faster next time if by any chance similar situations occur again. From the evolutionary biology point of view, it makes sense to spend less time judging if a lion is approaching or not, if you have barely survived last time from the lion-like problems. However, there are almost no extreme life or death threats today. Instead, the world became more complex than ever in a different way, forming a massive global network inter-wired like neurons in human brain, so it requires different approaches.         </p>
        <p>
          First, hasty judgement fully based on the experimental prior knowledge can probably function as the bias and prejudice, which distorting the truth. As the spectrum of life experience gets broader, there are surprisingly no exact same situations, if similar on the surface. The context, situation, luck and other conditions are dissimilar. Agile methodology and flexible adaptability are more adequate strategies under those complex fields.

          Second, social media has appeared. Seeing how well advertisements works proves the amazing film Inception is not a fiction. It is certain that we either affect people or conversely and unwittingly get influenced by other people's unprocessed opinions. Watching news with a wish to connect to the world ironically blinds people from the balanced thinking method. As Bruce Lee said "empty your cup so that it may be filled", not only we need to know how to learn, but also how to unlearn.

            <p>Sometimes the more information that is given, the harder it is to make a decision-the classic example of an overfitting problem. The general idea behind this concept is that we might get more information, but we become too sensitive to make the correct decision. One way to stop his problem is “early stopping”, which simply means a decision made with a few parts of the entire information. The standard of “early” can be tricky, but the more complex and unstable it is, it is better to stop earlier. Again back to an old cliché-“Too much is worse than less”</p>
