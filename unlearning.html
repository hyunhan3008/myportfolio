        Prediction has been one of our major interests in many areas. Bayes’s rule suggest that three different distributions(normal, power-law and Earlang) have their own corresponding optimal prediction rules(multiplicative, average and additive). It is obvious that choosing the right strategy is the key point for more accurate predictions. However, data given as prior knowledge cannot be ignored at all. For example, doctors in Korea understand body qualities of Korean people better than other races. When experiencing new situations, we gather information to react faster next time if similar situations possibly occur. From the evolutionary biology point of view, it make sense to spend less time to judge if a lion is approaching, if you have barely survived last time from a similar situation. However, there are almost no like that extreme life or death threats at present, Instead, the world is more complex than ever in a different way. First, hasty judgement based on the information acquired before will likely work as bias and prejudice. There are no similar situations. When they look similar seemingly, the context is totally different. Agile handling and adaptability is more desirable in this case(read more for the linear thinking)
        Second, human formed a massive unprecedented community on the earth, globalized by social media. To see how well advertisements work, It is needless to say that we are under other's influence unwittingly. Watching news to connect to the world ironically blind people to be biased.

              <p>Sometimes the more information that is given, the harder it is to make a decision-the classic example of an overfitting problem. The general idea behind this concept is that we might get more information, but we become too sensitive to make the correct decision. One way to stop his problem is “early stopping”, which simply means a decision made with a few part of the entire information. The standard of “early” can be tricky, but the more complex and unstable it is, it is better to stop earlier. Again back to an old cliché-“Too much is worse than less”</p>
