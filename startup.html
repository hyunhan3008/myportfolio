        <p>WHY?</p>
        <ui style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
          <li>
            Enhancing the level of  self-awareness.
            <p>
              It easily happens that people think they worked hard all day long, but not much in effect. If they are aware of how they spend a day objectively, it is possible to make a wiser time-management strategy by removing unnecessary choices. Not working-hard-mode just to return to the same state, but to evaluate objectively to make true improvements. If you cannot measure, you cannot control it.
              A leading clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson emphasized on individual responsibility as the first step for solving big problems facing humanity like global warming.

            To make deeper relations
            <p>
              The complexity of social media networking is soaring. People long for likes and attention from other people by faking and manipulating reality, which result in the arrogant vanity and depression. 
              Instead of adjusting to and defining oneself by external stimulus, forming deeper humane relationships by showing share one's normal life.

        <p>What is it? </p>
        <p>
          A self-oriented virtual platform service that a user can log everyday life to know thyself and offer others(friends, acquaintance, potential friends, etc) actual timeline-based accumulated data as factual evidence to let them better understand of you for the purpose of building stronger and meaningful relations; compared to the other outdated social medias that is dragging people into a quagmire of self-hate.
